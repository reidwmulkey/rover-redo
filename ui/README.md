# UI

This is an angular 1.6 application, running md-angular. In order to run it, you will need to install the latest version of nodeJS. once that is done, you can navigate to this directory and run:

```
npm install -g live-server
npm run serve
```

which will host the application on http://localhost:8080/

I have also hosted this application on EC2:

```
http://ec2-54-71-181-39.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/
```

I did not want to also buy a DNS/static public IP/etc. since this won't be up long, so if it goes down, just email me.
